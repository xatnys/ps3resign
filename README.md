==============

Quick and dirty script for re-signing SCE files. Requires only naehrwert's scetool for now.

## future stuff (todo)
* Automatically parse NPDRM SELFs.
* Option to output NPDRM signed SELFs
* Friendlier way to override the firmware version and key revision
* The ability to pack/unpack SCE package files (.pkg)
* Use existing modfied ELFs
